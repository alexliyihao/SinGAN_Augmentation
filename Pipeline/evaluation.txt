1. time cost:
  For each approach:
    representative_selection -- instant
    augmentation:
      with n representatives,
        the training of SinGAN should take (n*40) mins
        the training of BAGAN and ACGAN takes about 6-8 hours
    evaluation training: should be in 1 hours
    i.e. the final result should take about ~10 hours to generate, for each approach

2. experiment designation

  test 1
  Representative_selection vs training models on each images on small image set
  (From discussion last time, this result should be generally the same, this step is to validate
  that representative selection can create result on par while the significantly reduce the training time)

      From group 3's result the result of geometric, BAGAN, and training models on each images existed,
      we need to test 3 labels and get an average
          MNIST 10*6000*28*28*3
          CIFAR10 10*5000*32*32*3
          2 dataset * 3 label = 6 tests (ACGAN and Representative_selection only)

  test 2
  augmentation quality
  geometric vs ACGAN vs BAGAN vs representative
  Tiny Imagenet consists of 200 categories (i.e. classes) where each category has
  500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images (200*500*224*224*3)

      Random sample 10 classes (to 10*500*224*224*3) for 3 time, drop 1 class
      drop rate 40/60/75/90/95, 15 test in total

      210 hours expected
